## 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** for professional Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). 

Deployments are triggered **manually** via the GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`.

### Automated Pipeline Capabilities:
1. **Android Deployment**: Decodes Keystores on-the-fly, builds the signed `.aab`, and uploads directly to the Google Play Console internal/production tracks.
2. **iOS Deployment**: Sets up macOS keychains, decodes `.p12` certificates and provisioning profiles, builds the signed `.ipa`, and uploads directly to App Store Connect (TestFlight) using `altool`.

*(Note: Never commit your Keystores or Certificates. They must be stored as Base64 strings in your GitHub Repository Secrets).*
